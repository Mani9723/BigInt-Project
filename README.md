# BigInt-Project /////// INCOMPLETE PROJECT/////////
This class is already provided in the Java Package.
However, I am doing this for practice and skill building.

This class will accept a string argument provided by the user.
Then the user will be able to perform the following operations on the the string:
        Addition
        Subtraction
        Multiplication
        Division
        Modulus
 It's currently a work in progress. Hopefully I will be able to finish it soon.
